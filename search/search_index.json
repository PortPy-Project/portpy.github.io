Radiotherapy plays a critical role in  treating over half of all cancer patients, whether as a standalone treatment or in combination with surgery,  chemotherapy, or immunotherapy. It works by delivering high-energy radiation beams to tumors, aiming to destroy  cancerous cells while minimizing damage to the surrounding healthy tissues.  Given that each patient has a unique anatomy, it is essential to customize the  radiation beams' shape, angle, and intensity. The goal is to maximize damage to the  tumor while minimizing exposure to healthy surrounding tissues. This challenge translates into modeling and  solving large-scale,  patient-specific mathematical optimization problems. PortPy aims to accelerate research  in this interdisciplinary field by offering tools, baseline algorithms, and benhcmark datasets.</p>"},{"location":"#main-features","title":"\ud83d\ude80 Main Features","text":"<ul> <li> <p>IMRT/VMAT Planning Optimization (including AI):   Includes support for IMRT fluence map optimization and leaf sequencing (see notebook),  VMAT direct aperture optimization  (see notebook),  AI-based dose-prediction IMRT  (see notebook)  and VMAT (see notebook) planning. </p> </li> <li> <p>Integration with Commercial TPS:   PortPy outputs IMRT/VMAT plans in DICOM-RT format which can be exported into commercial TPSs  (see notebook).
