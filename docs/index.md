# **What is PortPy?**

**PortPy**, short for **P**lanning and **O**ptimization for **R**adiation **T**herapy, is an open-source Python library 
designed to advance cancer radiotherapy treatment planning optimization. Radiotherapy plays a critical role in 
treating over half of all cancer patients, whether as a standalone treatment or in combination with surgery, 
chemotherapy, or immunotherapy. It works by delivering high-energy radiation beams to tumors, aiming to destroy 
cancerous cells while minimizing damage to the surrounding healthy tissues. 
Since every patient has a unique anatomy, the radiation beamâ€™s shape, angle, and intensity must be carefully 
customized. The objective is to maximize tumor dose while minimizing exposure to nearby organs at riskâ€”a 
challenge that translates into solving large-scale, patient-specific mathematical optimization problems.

PortPy aims to accelerate research in this interdisciplinary field by providing tools and algorithms 
to model and solve these complex optimization problems, as well as to visualize and quantitatively 
evaluate the resulting treatment plans (see image below).

## ðŸš€ PortPy Main Features

- **IMRT/VMAT Planning Optimization (including AI):**  
  Includes support for IMRT fluence map optimization and leaf sequencing (see [notebook](https://github.com/PortPy-Project/PortPy/blob/master/examples/1_basic_tutorial.ipynb)), 
VMAT direct aperture optimization 
(see [notebook](https://github.com/PortPy-Project/PortPy/blob/master/examples/vmat_scp_tutorial.ipynb)), 
AI-based dose-prediction IMRT 
(see [notebook](https://github.com/PortPy-Project/PortPy/blob/master/examples/imrt_dose_prediction.ipynb)) 
and VMAT (see [notebook](https://github.com/PortPy-Project/PortPy/blob/master/examples/vmat_scp_dose_prediction.ipynb)) planning. 

- **Integration with Commercial TPS:**  
  PortPy outputs IMRT/VMAT plans in DICOM-RT format which can be exported into commercial TPSs 
(see [notebook](https://github.com/PortPy-Project/PortPy/blob/master/examples/vmat_tps_import.ipynb)). For Eclipse TPS users:
    - PortPy outputs IMRT optimal fluence maps in an Eclipse-compatible format (see [notebook](https://github.com/PortPy-Project/PortPy/blob/master/examples/imrt_tps_import.ipynb)).
    - It supports automated data extraction (e.g., beamlets, voxels, dose influence matrix)  
  from Eclipse via its scripting API in a PortPy-compatible format (see [notebook](https://github.com/PortPy-Project/PortPy/blob/master/examples/eclipse_photon_dose_calculation.ipynb)).

- **Benchmark Datasets:**  
  Provides access to a curated dataset of **100 lung cancer patients** with all necessary components for treatment planning optimization 
(beamlet, voxel, pre-computed dose influence matrix). IMRT plans generated using our in-house automated planning 
system, **ECHO**, are included for benchmarking  

- **Globally Optimal IMRT/VMAT Plans:**  
  Implements slow but exact algorithms (e.g., Mixed-Integer Programming) to compute globally optimal plans, useful for benchmarking and validating heuristic algorithms.


## ðŸ“¢ News
- **[PortPy v1.1.0 released]** The following features have been added:
    
     - **Eclipse users can use their own dataset**: For more info, see [notebook](https://github.com/PortPy-Project/PortPy/blob/master/examples/eclipse_photon_dose_calculation.ipynb).
     - **Lung benchmark dataset expanded**: Lung dataset expanded to 100 patients and is now hosted on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/PortPy-Project), 
      making it easier to access and use them in your research (see [notebook](https://github.com/PortPy-Project/PortPy/blob/master/examples/1_basic_tutorial.ipynb)).
     - **VMAT column generation algorithm added**: It finds a "warm start" 
      (i.e., good but not neceassirily optimal) solution quickly for the current VMAT SCP (Sequential Convex Programming) optimization algorithm (see [notebook](https://github.com/PortPy-Project/PortPy/blob/master/examples/vmat_scp_tutorial.ipynb)).
     - **Enhanced visualization**: The evaluation table has been improved for better readability and analysis (see [notebook](https://github.com/PortPy-Project/PortPy/blob/master/examples/1_basic_tutorial.ipynb)).
