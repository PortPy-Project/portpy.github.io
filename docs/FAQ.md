### **What kind of license does PortPy use?**
PortPy code is distributed under the **Apache 2.0 license with the Commons Clause**.  
It is available **free for non-commercial academic purposes**.  
For commercial use, please contact the PortPy PI, Masoud Zarepisheh at [zarepism@mskcc.org](mailto:zarepism@mskcc.org).

### **How can I use my own patient data?**
PortPy currently supports importing patient data only from the **Eclipse TPS** using its API  
([see notebook](https://github.com/PortPy-Project/PortPy/blob/master/examples/eclipse_photon_dose_calculation.ipynb)). This includes extracting all necessary data for optimization,  
such as the **dose influence matrix** (i.e., a 2D matrix representing 3D dose distributions  
from thousands of beamlets).

### **Can I use other open-source software for dose calculation and PortPy for planning optimization?**
One of PortPyâ€™s goals is to generate **clinically usable, deliverable plans** with dose calculations  
that match commercial TPS accuracy. This focus makes PortPy not only a clinically relevant platform but also a 
powerful research tool for benchmarking optimization algorithms and their resultant treatment plans against the 
clinical plans. Therefore, we currently do **not** support integrating other open-source dose engines into PortPy. 
However, users are welcome to use PortPy solely for planning optimization and perform dose calculations using other 
software, provided this setup meets the needs of their research or application.

### **Can I do proton therapy optimization with PortPy?**
PortPy currently only supports **photon planning optimization**.  
Proton therapy support is expected to be released in 2026.

---

### **I have a medical physics background but not in mathematical optimization. Can I still use PortPy?**
Absolutely. PortPy is designed to be **user-friendly and accessible**.  
You can get started using our ready-made **Jupyter Notebooks and tutorials** without needing  
a deep understanding of optimization theory.

---

### **I have a mathematical optimization background but not in medical physics. Can I still use PortPy?**
Yes. Many PortPy contributors come from optimization and engineering backgrounds.  
The **benchmark datasets** and **baseline algorithms** are designed to help users without  
medical physics expertise explore radiotherapy treatment planning.

---

### **I have an engineering/software development background. Can I contribute to PortPy?**
Yes! PortPy is an open-source project and **welcomes community contributions**.  
Please reach out to Gourav Jhanwar, Lead Developer ([jhanwarg@mskcc.org](mailto:jhanwarg@mskcc.org)).
